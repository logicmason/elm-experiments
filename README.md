===============

Elm is a functional reactive programming (FRP) language that compiles to HTML, CSS, and JS. FRP is a concise and elegant way to create highly interactive applications and avoid callbacks.

This is a language that I've been intrigued by for months now and will be writing programs and posting my learnings on here. Try code or write your own at http://elm-lang.org/try.
